# RNA Folding Problem
=====================================

## Running the Code
-------------------

To run the code, simply use the following command:
```bash
python3 A3.py
```
Optionally, you can provide the RNA sequence as a command line argument:
```bash
python3 A3.py <RNA_sequence>
```
If no sequence is provided, the code will default to the problem string given in the assignment:
```
AUGGCUACCGGUCGAUUGAGCGCCAAUGUAAUCAUU
```

## Dynamic Programming Solution
-------------------------------

The DP solution considers an interval $b_i$ to $b_j$ within a given RNA sequence $b_0 b_1 b_2...b_n$, $\forall i, j \in Z \intersection [0, n)$ referencing solutions to smaller intervals stored in a memory matrix as it builds up to the entire sequence where $i=0$ and $j=n-1$, giving us the final solution.
